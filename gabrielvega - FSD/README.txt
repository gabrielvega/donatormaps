Instructions to deploy and start the app.

In the terminal execute the following commands:
- npm install
- node .

It will start a server listening on localhost:3000



Feedback
    As a feedback I could say that the first time I readed the Instructions I thought that I had to use MEAN CLI from
    (mean.io). Maybe it's a silly thing but I want to be open with you.
