Instructions to deploy and start the app.
==================================================

In the terminal execute the following command:
 - npm install

To start the app
 - npm start

For testing
$ npm start

(In other terminal)
$ npm test

==================================================

It will start a server listening on localhost:3000
You can change the host and port setting process.env.HOST and process.env.PORT respectively

==================================================

Mising requirements

- If any pin changes, the change should be visible real time (udpdate, delete)
- As the user navigates the map, more pins should load accorddingly
- In place of phone number should be lazy loaded.

==================================================

Feedback
    As a feedback I could say that the first time I readed the Instructions I thought that I had to use MEAN CLI from
    (mean.io). Maybe it's a silly thing but I want to be open with you.
